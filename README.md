## Description
* Welcome to my algorithm repository. Algorithms offer great opportunities to both challenge my problem solving skills as well as refine my code while practicing for job interviews and real world applications. I participate in a code-challenge group twice a for experience problem solving with a team, as well as attempting problems on my own. I write solutions in different programming languages to perfect my fluency in multiple proficiencies.

## Current Project
* I am currently working through HackerRank's Interview Preparation Kit.
